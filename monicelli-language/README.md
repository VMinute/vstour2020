# monicelli-language README

This is a small extension sample for Visual Studio Code. 
It supports the [Monicelli language](https://github.com/esseks/monicelli).

The language grammar has been converted from the [atom package](https://github.com/esseks/language-monicelli) using [CSON-Json converter](https://cson-json-converter.netlify.app/).
This code is supposed to be used as a sample of how you can implement support for a new or existing language in vscode.

The repo include a binary of the compiler that runs on ubuntu 18.04, it can be used also on Windows as long as WSL and ubuntu 18 are installed.
