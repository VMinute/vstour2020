# monicelli-language README

This is a small extension sample for Visual Studio Code. 
It supports the [Monicelli language](https://github.com/esseks/monicelli).

The language grammar has been converted from the [atom package](https://github.com/esseks/language-monicelli) using [CSON-Json converter](https://cson-json-converter.netlify.app/).
This code is supposed to be used as a sample of how you can implement support for a new or existing language in vscode.
