# Visual Studio Code Extensions for Dummies - Visual Studio Tour 2020 #

This repo container samples and slide from my session about Visual Studio Code extension development for the Italian Visual Studio Tour 2020 event.
Slides can be displayed using the [vscode-reveal](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=evilz.vscode-reveal) extension.
This is a 40' overview, so not all the extension kinds and features are covered.
Feel free to use it as base for your own presentations. I will appreciate if you mention the original author in your presentation.
There are multiple samples in the different subfolders, each subfolder can be opened in a separate instance of Visual Studio Code.

## sample-extension ##

This folder contains the code generated by the:

```
yo code
```

command. It is used to show the main components of an extension (package.js, the code, node modules).

## ui-demo ##

This demo shows how to access the VSCode ui-related features like inputbox, quickpick, messages and output channels.
It also implements a very simple view, showing how the data model can be used to remap a data structure in a tree-view.

## minicelli-language ##

This extension shows a minimal implementation of a language extension.
It supports the [Monicelli 2.0 "Cofandina"](https://github.com/esseks/monicelli) programming languge, showing how to support syntax highlighting, a grammar and a custom build command.
